   <blockquote>Sorry for the prologue. But that's how the soul tells. Elderly people are like children, and unfortunately this awaits all of us (( . It‚Äôs a matter of time. This is our physiology). The sensor is very necessary, because mom already needs to pick up insulin. It‚Äôs always scary for beginners. You need to see the reaction body for insulins. I am very grateful to @diabet.fund Eduard for the existence of this fund. I am grateful to those sponsors who help this fund. Thank you to everyone who participates in collecting parcels to help us. I believe that a good cause will continue its life.</blockquote>
