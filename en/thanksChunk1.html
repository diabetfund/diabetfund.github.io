Alya didn’t realize that you could walk with him, that you would be able to work correctly and weigh the term, more richly nuanced. Not seeming already for the price, to put them on a permanent basis. Okremo dyakuyu, for those scho fingers nareshti vіdpochinit vіd 8 months pierce 100 times a day. We spent three days with the person being restored, more nervous! And everything turned out miraculous, the little one didn’t remember and didn’t eat yoga! I don’t say that, I don’t say words, you can pick up and tell Eduard, Sergius, and we can help someone! Great for the 50/50 program on the sensor and the ability to try it!</blockquote>

   <blockquote>Sorry for the prologue. But that's how the soul tells. Elderly people are like children, and unfortunately this awaits all of us (( . It’s a matter of time. This is our physiology). The sensor is very necessary, because mom already needs to pick up insulin. It’s always scary for beginners. You need to see the reaction body for insulins. I am very grateful to @diabet.fund Eduard for the existence of this fund. I am grateful to those sponsors who help this fund. Thank you to everyone who participates in collecting parcels to help us. I believe that a good cause will continue its life.</blockquote>
