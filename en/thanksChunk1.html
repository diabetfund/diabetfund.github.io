   <blockquote>Do not hang out with words like my vdyachni! The little one was diagnosed with diabetes. From that hour I wanted to install that sensor. Alya didn’t realize that you could walk with him, that you would be able to work correctly and weigh the term, more richly nuanced. Not seeming already for the price, to put them on a permanent basis. Okremo dyakuyu, for those scho fingers nareshti vіdpochinit vіd 8 months pierce 100 times a day. We spent three days with the person being restored, more nervous! And everything turned out miraculous, the little one didn’t remember and didn’t eat yoga! I don’t say that, I don’t say words, you can pick up and tell Eduard, Sergius, and we can help someone! Great for the 50/50 program on the sensor and the ability to try it!</blockquote>

   <blockquote>The whole family is infinitely grateful 🧡 For the sensor, for the drops, the sugar substitute and for the past help as a Libra 2 reader! Because you won't appreciate all the benefits right away, it takes time) Many people are scared of measuring mg/dL and numbers per 100. A few days and we were clearly oriented! Such an irreplaceable thing especially with a very young child, because now it is possible to leave the grandchild with the grandmother and not leave your phone! Because the little one just doesn't have it... Of course, a separate "cherry on the cake" is a notification about a low or too high glucose level, because the little one won't tell, especially when she's sleeping! And no calibrations! Everything shows right away 👍 Little Lily's fingers are really resting 🧡 Just a HUGE thank you to the entire foundation and of course to Sergey and Eduard personally! Just because you are! And this is how you help our diabetics, young and old, despite all the negativity!🙏</blockquote>
