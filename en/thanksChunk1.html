Thank you, it is scary to imagine our life without modern devices for measuring sugar (pounds), especially when a child does not feel high and low sugars. Libra is our eyes. Thank goodness we can see sugar painlessly. May all your big plans come true!!! And God always protects!!!</blockquote>

   <blockquote>The whole family is infinitely grateful 🧡 For the sensor, for the drops, the sugar substitute and for the past help as a Libra 2 reader! Because you won't appreciate all the benefits right away, it takes time) Many people are scared of measuring mg/dL and numbers per 100. A few days and we were clearly oriented! Such an irreplaceable thing especially with a very young child, because now it is possible to leave the grandchild with the grandmother and not leave your phone! Because the little one just doesn't have it... Of course, a separate "cherry on the cake" is a notification about a low or too high glucose level, because the little one won't tell, especially when she's sleeping! And no calibrations! Everything shows right away 👍 Little Lily's fingers are really resting 🧡 Just a HUGE thank you to the entire foundation and of course to Sergey and Eduard personally! Just because you are! And this is how you help our diabetics, young and old, despite all the negativity!🙏</blockquote>
