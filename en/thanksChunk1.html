We spent three days with the person being restored, more nervous! And everything turned out miraculous, the little one didn’t remember and didn’t eat yoga! I don’t say that, I don’t say words, you can pick up and tell Eduard, Sergius, and we can help someone! Great for the 50/50 program on the sensor and the ability to try it!</blockquote>

   <blockquote>Good afternoon, dear admins and personally Igor, Alex, as well as dear group. I am very grateful for the sugar substitute and vitamins for diabetes. I received it, I was very happy, very grateful for your concern and care for us diabetics !! especially since I could not pick up either the glucometer or my stevia from Bakhmut. You are very attentive to us. You know that sometimes we also want something sweet. God sees your work and will appreciate it, just as we appreciate it by 10 points. You have already provided and will continue to provide thousands of people with diabetes with your work. Thanks a lot. Peace to all of us!!!!</blockquote>
