<p><br><br>"Maintaining normal well-being in type 2 diabetes is not primarily about medication, but about proper nutrition and lifestyle changes," is a well-known statement made by a team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen.<br><br>According to them, replacing pasta, bread and potatoes with foods high in protein (meat, eggs) can significantly improve blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.<br><br>To confirm their hypothesis, the researchers collected 16 people with type 2 diabetes, aged 43 to 70 years (average age - 65 years). After that, the participants were divided into 2 groups and one of them was transferred to a high-carbohydrate diet, and the other - to a low-carbohydrate diet. Also, for the purity of the experiment, the researchers canceled the use of sugar-lowering drugs (eg, metformin) for both groups.<br><br>According to the results of the study, the second group of subjects reduced the consumption of energy derived from carbohydrates from 29% to 16% and increased the consumption of energy derived from proteins from 31% to 54%.<br><br>Despite the lower amount of "carbohydrate" energy, the subjects did not experience a shortage of food. On the contrary, they reported that a low-carb diet helped to overcome the feeling of hunger between meals and reduce the number of snacks.<br><br>The results of the study complement the evidence on how eating low-carb foods can improve general well-being in people with type 2 diabetes.<br><br>Thus, Copenhagen researchers found that those who followed a high-protein diet reduced postprandial glucose by 18% and reduced total insulin by 22% compared with those who followed a high-carbohydrate diet.<br><br>They also found that levels of the other two metabolic hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide 1, increased by 35% and 17%, respectively.<br><br>Researchers say more work is needed to investigate the effects of a high-protein diet on diabetes over time.<br><br>The findings were published in the journal Nature Medicine.</p>
