<p><br><br>It is often used in the morning or at bedtime as basal insulin to help control sugar levels throughout the day.<br><br>Insulin is produced inside the beta cells of the pancreas. With type 2 diabetes, the body may lose the ability to produce insulin, or if insulin is produced, the body cannot use it properly (insulin resistance). Different types of insulin therapy, such as long-acting insulin, help the body get the insulin it needs for optimal glycemic control.<br><br>The effects of other types of insulin, ultrashort and short, begin immediately after administration. Their level of maximum activity is reached within one or two hours, after which the effect passes and the body needs another injection. Short and ultrashort insulins are designed to instantly lower blood sugar: they are given immediately after a meal as soon as large doses of glucose begin to enter the bloodstream. The effect of both drugs lasts no more than 4-8 hours.<br><br>Unlike short-acting insulins, prolonged insulin is the basis of treatment. It is administered in the morning or at night to simulate the work of the pancreas as accurately as possible. Depending on the type of drug, the duration of action can reach 28 hours: drugs of medium duration (valid for about 15 hours) and drugs of long-term exposure (up to 30 hours). Also, the nature of the disease may prolong or delay the effect of the drug.<br><br>Dosage and injection site are important for sugar control. When the doctor sets the insulin dose for patients, he considers how long it takes for the drug to peak. Another feature of long-acting insulin is the injection site. Unlike short-acting drugs that are injected into the abdomen or arm, prolonged insulin is placed in the thigh - this allows you to achieve the effect of gradual entry of the drug into the body.<br><br>There are several types of prolonged insulin, such as Levevmir and Basaglar. Most of them are cloudy, and their peak activity occurs 7 hours after injection and they are administered twice a day. Other drugs (eg, Tresiba) are administered once a day. The difference between them is the duration of work, the duration of absorption and the appearance of drugs. So Tresiba lasts longer than Levevmir, has no peak absorption, and, unlike Levevmir, the drug is transparent, without sediment.<br><br>A doctor's consultation will help you choose the treatment and the most appropriate drugs for a particular patient. The specialist will select the basic insulin of medium or long action and say the names of the best drugs.<br><br>Doctors do not recommend choosing prolonged insulin on your own.</p>
