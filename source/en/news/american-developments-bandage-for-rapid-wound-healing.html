<p><br><br>Because diabetics often have problems with the nervous system / circulation, they may not pay attention to ulcers, wounds or abrasions. Due to the slow healing of wounds, such inattention can lead to complications such as chronic wounds. A new regenerative bandage, however, can help avoid this.<br><br>The bandage device, created by researchers at Northwestern University in Illinois, uses the body's own ability to regenerate and does not contain drugs or other pharmaceutical products. According to the author of the study, Professor Guillermo Amer, the main active ingredient in the bandage is artificially synthesized body protein.<br><br>"We found in the skin the protein segment most important for wound healing, isolated it and included it in the antioxidant hydrogel bandage, which is first applied to the skin and then, after heating to body temperature, thickens into a hard gel," said Professor Amer. .<br><br>Thanks to its components, the bandage smoothes the surface of the wound, filling all its recesses and nooks. To develop new cells, it creates a three-dimensional structure similar to scaffolding, which promotes rapid tissue regeneration. After use, the bandage is washed off with cool saline solution.<br><br>"Wounds have the wrong shape and depth. Our liquid can fill any shape and then stay in place. Other bandages are often based on collagen films or sponges that move and move away from the damaged area, ‚Äùadded Professor Amer.<br><br>Laboratory studies conducted to date show that the bandage accelerates wound healing by 33% faster than the most popular of the existing bandages without side effects. Researchers at Northwestern University plan to conduct several more large-scale testing of the bandage and obtain official approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the spread of the bandage in the medical sector.<br><br>Although this new technology can be used to treat any wound, the research team has focused on helping diabetics at risk for lower extremity injuries.<br><br>Most people with diabetes will have at least one leg ulcer at some point in their lives. If you consult a specialist in time and get proper medical care, you can get rid of ulcers quickly. If left untreated, it can lead to infection or even amputation.</p>
