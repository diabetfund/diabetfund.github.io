                       Type 1 Diabetes
                   </strong>
                   This type of disease is called insulin-dependent because the body cannot produce insulin
                   on its own and the patient requires daily doses of drugs to prolong life. Type 1 diabetes
                   is most common among children and adolescents. But in medical practice, there were isolated
                   cases of the disease among adults under 30 years old. Approximately 10% of those patients who
                   contacted a doctor with typical symptoms suffer from type 1 diabetes.

                   Approximately 90% of patients are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. It is also called
                   insulin-independent because the hormone is produced in the body, but blood cells do not
                   respond to it. Insulin injections as a treatment are given only in extreme cases. When the
                   disease is diagnosed at an early stage, the patient can be effectively influenced by lifestyle
                   changes and dietary adjustments. Type 2 diabetes is most often diagnosed among women over 30 years old.

               Evolution of the disease
           </h2>
           <p>
               Type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreatic gland and
               permanently destroys their ability to produce insulin. When the body produces enough insulin,
               glucose from the blood enters the cells of various organs and its residues are stored in the
               tissues of the liver and the muscles. If a person requires additional energy between meals,
               for example, during sleep or physical activities, the body uses these reserves.
           </p>
           <p>
               With type 1 diabetes, glucose does not enter the cells due to insulin deficiency and its
               level rises rapidly, which is why the symptoms of the disease appear very quickly. Patients
               immediately feel a strong thirst and dryness in the mouth, they rush several times in the
               night to go to the toilet, and the volume of the urine significantly increases.
           </p>
           <p>
               In the case of the second type of diabetes, the tissues of the body consume and utilize
               significantly less glucose. Blood sugar level can grow for years without causing any symptoms of
               the disease. Then the body starts to produce borrowed glucose through the nerves. Together with the
               urine, salts and liquid are released from the body, which causes dehydration and imbalance of electrolytes.
               People experience the first symptoms of the disease.

               The risk of the disease is that it does not reveal itself in any way at the initial
               stages, so it is necessary to take a glucose test on an empty stomach on a regular
               basis. If the most abnormal findings occur, the physician will refer the patient for
               a full examination to find out the cause of the high blood glucose concentration and to recommend further treatment.
               Blood samples can be taken free of charge upon referral from the family physician.
