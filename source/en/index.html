                   We have great news - the opening of a unique Health and Rehabilitation Center (ORC) for diabetics in Slovakia is planned soon.
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                   With the support of the Charitable Foundation and all concerned citizens, the Center will provide comprehensive assistance to Ukrainians with diabetes, both children and adults. The main building can accommodate up to 125 people, so there is enough space for everyone.
                  </p>
                  <b>
                   Collection of donations is already open!

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                   You can help pay for a trip to the Center for a person with diabetes and their companion. The foundation covers most of the costs of patients staying in our Center on its own, and with your support we can collect enough money and provide our citizens with a full course of the health program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Every donation counts. You can donate 1 day or pay for the entire rehabilitation course at the Center.

                  The prevalence of diabetes throughout the world and in Ukraine is rapidly and steadily increasing. Each day of a person with diabetes is a constant balancing act between sugar, acetone, dangerous risks of coma and threats of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation, etc.
                 </p> 
                 <p>
                  At the same time, there were always interruptions in the supply of high-quality insulin, there were no assistance programs for people with diabetes, there was no provision of insulin pumps and blood glucose monitoring systems, and payments for state social assistance reached an extremely low level. Since the full-scale invasion of Russia, all these problems have increased and multiplied, becoming critical.

                  To date, there are no accurate data on the number of patients in Ukraine, because statistics have not been kept for five years. Based on how quickly the number of patients is increasing all over the world, it can be noted that the number reaches several million Ukrainians. In addition, the stress factor experienced by our citizens in the last six months is one of the main factors in the occurrence of diabetes.
