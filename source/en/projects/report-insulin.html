<h1>What was done within the project</h1>
<p>Over the past few months, more than 350 people have received drugs as part of the "Help with Insulin" need. Together we managed to help in the amount of more than 300,000 UAH. Thanks to the support of
   our partners and all concerned people, the most needy patients - retirees, children and low-income
   citizens received essential goods</p>
<p>Many Ukrainians now lack the money to cover their basic needs, so the help provided in the form of
   medicines is extremely important. The charity fund will continue to raise funds and provide
   up-to-date information on social media pages. We post photo activity reports each time to engage as
   many people as possible in further supporting diabetics.</p>
