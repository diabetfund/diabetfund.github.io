<p>Warm up Kherson! The project is aimed at raising funds for the purchase of pellets for heating. The volume is 20
    tons, UAH 12,300 per ton.</p>
<h1>Tasks of the project:&nbsp;</h1>
<p>In a few weeks, winter will begin, which we will encounter for the first time during the war. The enemy counts on
    cold and darkness as their weapons. Turning to our international partners, I want to say: we are counting on you!
    This is a humanitarian challenge unique in its scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time, schools will be heated in a minimal mode to maintain the heating system, and teachers can go on paid
    leave during the holidays if they wish. In the event of an emergency in the city, part of the schools will be used
    for the operation of heating points.&nbsp;</p>
