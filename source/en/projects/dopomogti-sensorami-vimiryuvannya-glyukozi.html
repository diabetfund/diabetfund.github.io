<p>According to official data, 2.5 million diabetics are registered in Ukraine. 1 million people are insulin
    dependent, 100,000 of whom are children. the number of people with this disease has increased significantly
    since the beginning of the war. Our ultimate goal is to purchase innovative developments for diabetics. Everyone
    who cares can join the fundraiser and contribute to a good cause.</p>
<h1>The project objectives:</h1>
<p>The number of people who need modern medical devices to control their diabetes is growing every day. We plan to
    purchase sensors of the latest models - Libre and Dexcom, which are suitable for both children and adults with
    type I disease. With these devices, sugar levels can be measured without piercing one's fingers. The use of
    sensors does not cause pain, and the results are stored in the device's memory. The device also warns of the
    danger of changing sugar levels in a timely manner, which greatly facilitates the lives of diabetics.</p>
<p>The sensors are installed for 14 days, and all the necessary data can be seen on the phone. This is a great
    advantage for parents, who will be able to control their children's level of glucose&nbsp; while they are in
    school or kindergarten. If necessary, parents can call the teacher or caregiver and warn about fluctuations in
    the child's sugar level to inject a dose of insulin or, conversely, give something sweet, especially for children,
    it is like air for them.</p>
