<p>Charitable foundation helps people who suffer from diabetes and need urgent medical care. We
    understand the importance of public support, and therefore encourage everyone to join the fundraiser
    and provide patients with the opportunity to live a full life.</p>
<h1>Project objectives:</h1>
<p>In the accordance with the official data, there are 2.5 million diabetics in Ukraine, including 1
    million people with type I (insulin-dependent). The number of people with this diagnosis began to
    grow rapidly with the beginning of the war. About 130,000 people with type 1 diabetes and more than
    2.3 million with type 2 diabetes need insulin and other vital medical devices. Our team does
    everything possible to provide many citizens with effective drugs. Not only the quality of therapy,
    but the average life expectancy of a diabetic depends on the right choice of drugs.</p>
