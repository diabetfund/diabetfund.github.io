Each day of a person with diabetes is a constant balancing act between sugar, acetone, dangerous risks of coma and threats of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation, etc.</p><p>At the same time, there were always interruptions in the supply of high-quality insulin, there were no assistance programs for people with diabetes, there was no provision of insulin pumps and blood glucose monitoring systems, and payments for state social assistance reached an extremely low level. Since the full-scale invasion of Russia, all these problems have increased and multiplied, becoming critical.</p><p><span class=" bold">To date, there are no accurate data on the number of patients in Ukraine, because statistics have not been kept for five years. Based on how quickly the number of patients is increasing all over the world, it can be noted that the number reaches several million Ukrainians. In addition, the stress factor experienced by our citizens in the last six months is one of the main factors in the occurrence of diabetes.</span></p><aside role="note" class=" GreenBackground"><span class="emoji">ðŸ’¡</span><div class="note"><h3 id="86b2b823-328a-4866-88f2-0fe617014c06">Mission and goals</h3><p>The mission of ORC is to teach people with diabetes to live a full life and to explain to them that diabetes is not a sentence, but a way of life.
