<p>One of the activities of the charity fund is medical care for the most vulnerable categories of the
    population. Our team buys the necessary devices and medicines and gives them to diabetics who do not
    have the opportunity to buy the necessary devices themselves.</p>
<p>We urge all concerned citizens to join the fundraiser, because every amount of money, even a small
    one, is significant.</p>
<h1>Project objectives</h1>
<p>Many categories of citizens lack vital drugs in the realities of today. We provide assistance to the
    elderly, children, low-income families and the military. The fund raises funds for glucometers and
    test strips, which are important tools for regular blood glucose monitoring. We choose only
    reliable, durable and easy to use devices. One of them is a modern Accu-Chek Performa device. It is
    quite compact and has a large intake window, which is ideal for people with impaired coordination.
